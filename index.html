      <p>
        I am a recent graduate from University of the Pacific. I recieved my Bachelor's degree in Bioengineering from
        the School of Engineering and Computer Science. On this page you will find a collection of my work
        related to engineering and design.

        The following is a visualization of the skills I have attained thus far, along with the relative amount of experience I have with each skill.
        The particular values are arbitrary. There are <span title="Like This One!" style="cursor:pointer">easter eggs</span> hidden in most of the tiles ðŸ«¡

      <p>
        On my <a href="https://github.com/rfryrice">Github</a> account you will find a data-science repository, which contains a collection of assignments
        I have completed as part of a bootcamp. At university I graduated with a Minor in Data Science, but most of the
        projects were done in a group. The repo contains projects I completed individually.

        I believe I have a solid understanding of Statistics and Machine Learning. I mainly use Python for analysis. I am currently exploring the 
        deep-learning framework Pytorch.
